### Notes:
Meeting with Ada and Craig re: IBM N/S naming scheme.

- Tray.IO now seems like it will stay for another year..

- North/South naming schema - 3 letter site code-"ASN"ASN numeric code

- ITRS/Uptrends  - service provider. ITRS - parent company, Uptrends is company owned by ITRS. AppNeta contracts  with ITRS.
    - Holding up IBM renewal, they want 1 year renewal, separate from IBM.
    - Hosting from outside in.  
    - No AppNeta access, simply install N10 client on their remote hosts. N10 show up in IBM N/S org.
