## Notes
- Showed API2SQL codebase to Providence, there is a high level of interest.
    - No need to set up time-based path data downloads.  The plan is to download, 1 or mulitple times a day and update weekly rtt average values.  I suggested storing no more than 1 months worth of path data.
- May not need to write final column row spreadsheet, leave that as an exercise for the Providence PowerBI team.
